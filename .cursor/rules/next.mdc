# Code Language and Comments
- Write all code and comments in English, except for variables and names that come from external sources like Prismic or Firebase
- Use English for all function names, component names, and documentation
- Keep external data source names (from Prismic, Firebase, etc.) in their original language/format

# Layout and Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS and HTML elements to create component and page layouts
- Avoid using MUI layout components like Box and Grid for layout purposes
- Prefer semantic HTML elements with Tailwind classes for structure
- Use flexbox and grid utilities from Tailwind for responsive layouts

# MUI Component Usage
- Use MUI components when appropriate for interactive elements like spinners, calendars, date pickers, etc.
- Prefer MUI components for form elements, modals, and other complex UI interactions
- Use MUI components that provide functionality not easily achievable with plain HTML + Tailwind

# MUI Version Compatibility
- This project uses MUI version 6
- Avoid using components marked as deprecated in MUI v6
- Check MUI v6 documentation for current component APIs and alternatives
- Use modern MUI v6 patterns and avoid legacy APIs

# Package Management
- Use Yarn as the package manager, not NPM
- Use `yarn add` instead of `npm install` for adding dependencies
- Use `yarn remove` instead of `npm uninstall` for removing dependencies
- Use `yarn` instead of `npm run` for running scripts
- Always use `yarn.lock` for dependency locking

# User Interface Text
- Display all user-facing text in Brazilian Portuguese
- Use Brazilian Portuguese for buttons, labels, headings, error messages, and any text visible to users
- Keep UI text in Portuguese while maintaining English code structure
- Ensure all form labels, placeholders, and validation messages are in Portuguese
